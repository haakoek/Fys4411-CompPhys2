# Fys4411-CompPhys2

This repository contains coursework completed for Computational physics II: Quantum mechanical systems (http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4411/) during the spring 2016. In particular it consists of two mandatory projects (https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysics2/tree/gh-pages/doc/Projects/2016) which uses Variational Monte Carlo 
methods to solve for the groundstate energy of bosonic and fermionic systems. 

The first project is done in collaboration with Stian Goplen, while the second project is done in collaboration with Stian Goplen and John-Anders Stende.
